### 2024 Offseason- November

#### Inspection
- Added "Start playoff reinspection" button on the LRI requests page. All teams can be flagged for a playoff reinspection with a single tap on the LRI requests page. Tap this button on the last day of the event, prior to the last round of qualifications. Every team that completed their initial inspection will be moved to the "Waiting for inspector" section. Teams will be sorted chronologically by their last qualification match, so they can be quickly processed in order.

### 2024 Offseason- September

#### Inspection
- Added "on hold" state for in-progress inspections that do not currently require attention from inspectors
- Added log page to view the full history of inspection actions for a specific team
- Added checking of inspection items from the full checklist view (useful for inspectors who prefer to check items in arbitrary order)
- Added manual inspector assignment/unassignment buttons. Inspector assignment still happens implicitly when certain actions are taken, but in some cases the explicit assignment may be useful
- Added option to manually move a "not started" team to "waiting for inspector". This is useful for venues that don't support the inspection process that begins with weigh-in
- Weight values are now displayed in the main checklist view
- Weight values can now be entered and displayed in metric by tapping the units next to the input fields
- If a team is scheduled in an upcoming match, it will be displayed on the team's inspection page
- Added reinspection for items that require inspector attention after a team's initial certification
  - Teams can request reinspection themselves by scanning their Nexus code, tapping "Request reinspection" and filling out the form
  - FTAs can request reinspection for teams from the FTA notepad
  - Inspectors can flag teams for reinspection from the team's inspection page
- An inspector Slack channel can now be connected on the LRI requests page. The channel will receive a message anytime:
  - An inspector flags a checklist item for the LRI
  - An inspector flags a team for reinspection
  - An FTA flags a team for reinspection
  - A team requests reinspection by scanning their Nexus code and filling out the form
- A notification will now be sent to each team when their inspection is certified (if they have registered for notifications)
  - The message will include a reminder of the reinspection rule

### 2024 Offseason- June

#### API
- Added public API v1.1.0 which allows developers to use live event status data and match timing estimates in their own applications

#### Queuing
- Implemented "slide to queue" for touchscreen devices to reduce mistaken taps
- Updated queue timing tooltip to include detailed timing for each match. This can now be viewed when hovering over the match status chip on the main queuing screen
  - Estimated times will be shown for future status changes (with tilde)
  - Actual times will be shown for past status changes
  - Scheduled match start time will be shown if available
- Improved protection against accidental double queuing. A warning will now be shown if *any* user has updated a match status within the past 4 minutes. Select the confirmation checkbox to bypass the warning and queue anyway.
- Added underline in the filler team selection dialog if a team has not played in any matches yet
- Added "unset winner" option for playoff matches, in case of an accidental selection or late replay announcement
- Added schedule behind/ahead indicator to queuing dashboard header
- Added "Create filler match" button to the main queuing screen during practice matches

#### Teams list page
- Minor changes to simplify the teams table 
- Added column to indicate if each team has played in a match
- Added ability to create custom team check-off columns for arbitrary tracking of teams

#### Volunteer menu

      - Current `/`
  - Queuing: Scroll to now `/`

   ### 2023 Week 6 (v209)

   - Updated icons and style for team check-in status to improve contrast
   - Green check: fully checked in
   - Yellow person: Human member of drive team checked in, but no robot
   
   ![Updated icons](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2548822/229666756-e032dcfd-b75a-44c4-96f6-8e38715786f7.png)
   
   ### 2023 Week 2 (v197) 
   
   - Updated team phone number input field to include country selector. Team members with non-US phone numbers can either select their country with the flag dropdown or manually enter their country code preceeded by a `+`.
   
   ![Phone number country input](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2548822/223203303-a70dbc2f-0df6-421c-a1ad-7fea251944f5.png)
   
   - Team representatives for alliance selection can now be requested a bit sooner via the Tasks panel (once the last qual match is queued). While announcements can be made before this to remind teams they will need to send their representative by the end of qualifications, actually asking representatives to come to the field should not happen too early as teams are busy strategizing and making a student stand near the field for 30+ minutes is unnecessary
   - Single match queuing- if your venue does not have enough space to queue two matches deep (both "on deck" and "now queuing"), you can turn on the "Enable single match queuing" setting. This will disable the "Advance queue" functionality so you can individually queue matches. Each match will still have both "Now queuing" and "On deck" states, so you can send a slightly earlier notification and a final reminder.
   - Bug fix for date-time input fields that made it difficult to enter times on some devices
   - Added a button to clear a team from a playoff alliance, in case they were accidentally added as a backup team
