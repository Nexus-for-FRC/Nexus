   ### 2023 Week 6 (v209)

   - Updated icons and style for team check-in status to improve contrast
   - Green check: fully checked in
   - Yellow person: Human member of drive team checked in, but no robot
   
   ![Updated icons](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2548822/229666756-e032dcfd-b75a-44c4-96f6-8e38715786f7.png)
   
   ### 2023 Week 2 (v197) 
   
   - Updated team phone number input field to include country selector. Team members with non-US phone numbers can either select their country with the flag dropdown or manually enter their country code preceeded by a `+`.
   
   ![Phone number country input](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2548822/223203303-a70dbc2f-0df6-421c-a1ad-7fea251944f5.png)
   
   - Team representatives for alliance selection can now be requested a bit sooner via the Tasks panel (once the last qual match is queued). While announcements can be made before this to remind teams they will need to send their representative by the end of qualifications, actually asking representatives to come to the field should not happen too early as teams are busy strategizing and making a student stand near the field for 30+ minutes is unnecessary
   - Single match queuing- if your venue does not have enough space to queue two matches deep (both "on deck" and "now queuing"), you can turn on the "Enable single match queuing" setting. This will disable the "Advance queue" functionality so you can individually queue matches. Each match will still have both "Now queuing" and "On deck" states, so you can send a slightly earlier notification and a final reminder.
   - Bug fix for date-time input fields that made it difficult to enter times on some devices
   - Added a button to clear a team from a playoff alliance, in case they were accidentally added as a backup team
